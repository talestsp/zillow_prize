~ Different types of inputation (infer missing values; NAs)
    ~ Already implemented
        ~ col_mean: for numeric columns input value with the mean of the column, else the most frequent categorical
        ~ col_mean_fine: for numeric columns input value with the mean of the column, else random pick a value for the missing ones
        ~ fill_0: fills NA with 0 (very dummy)
        ~ drop: remove rows with NAs (avoid the problem)

    ~ To be implemented
        ~ cluster based
        ~ knn geographic
        ~ use predictive models
        ...

~ Implement other predictive models. Please follow the model's "interface" at src.ml.sklearn_ml.py
    ~ Already implemented models
        ~ H2ODeepLearning
        ~ H2OGradientBoosting
        ~ SKLearnLinearRegression
        ~ SKLearnRANSACRegression

    ~ To be implemented
        ~ DeepWater from H2O
        ~ Random Forest Regressor

~ Feature engineering
    ~ Features already created
        ~ knn-longitude-latitude: logerror of the nearest geographical neighbor

    ~ To be created
        ...

~ Plot relations between each column and the logerror. Scatter Plot would work well. Please use X axis as the non target column :)
